usage: zebu [-ptlvh] -i <path/to/input.zb> -o <path/to/output>
	-i (or --input)
		Specifies path to input file.
	
	-o (or --output)
		Specifies path for output files. *without file extension*.
		For instance, if one wanted zebu to produce 'dir/foo.c' and
		'dir/foo.h', one would invoke zebu with `-o dir/foo`.
	
	-p (or --prefix)
		Sets the prefix the generated code should have it's non-`static`
		functions and globals. This is useful to avoid symbol-conflicts
		when linking multiple parsers generated by zebu. The default
		value is 'zebu'.
	
	-t (or --template)
		Sets which parser-template zebu should use when generating it's
		output. Current options are 'charbuffer', 'piecewise-charbuffer'
		'readline', 'readline-with-driver', 'fileio', 'fileio-with-driver', 
		'myreadline-with-driver'. The default value is 'just-tables'.
	
	-l (or --minimize-lexer)
		Tells zebu to combine and simplify all tokenizers generated
		accross all parser-contexts. This operation may take some time
		depending on the language. This option is disabled by default.
	
	-v (or --verbose)
		Enables status-update/progress-percentage print-outs for the
		time-consuming algorthims: NFA-to-DFA, DFA-simplification,
		Lexer-Minimization and LL parser-generation.
	
	-h (or --help):
		Prints this help message.
